How this app was setup:

1. Install NPM
2. Use CRA (create-react-app) to quickly generate a skeleton app to work from (the command for this is npx create-react-app --typescript)
3. Install your basic dev dependencies to help keep the repo clean before starting; I use ESLint configured with the AirBNB standards and Prettier for formatting so that anyone can pick up and read my code easily
4. Install your app dependencies like react-router-dom, history, and node-sass
5. Get to developing

How to run this app:

1. clone and run npm install
2. run npm start

Further considerations for future development:

1. The UX and UI aren't very engaging right now, but this was done very quickly.
2. Limit the pictures shown on screen and load in increments via pagination.
